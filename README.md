===========

Python based Moneybook (Testdriven Development practice)

Target is to create a small financial application which is entirely build with the test-driven methodology.
This means before writing a function which does something, an testcase gets written which have to fail. Based on the thrown error messages the function gets build till the testcase does no more fail.
